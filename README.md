# X-scraper

This project is a Jupyter Notebook-based web scraper designed to collect Twitter posts based on a user-provided Twitter username (e.g., `@example_user`).

### Prerequisites

- Python (preferably version 3.8 or higher)
- A Conda virtual environment

### Setup Instructions

1. **Set up a Conda Environment**
   Create or activate a Conda virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda create -n x
   conda activate x
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**
   Download and install the necessary Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Code

1. Navigate to the notebook file (e.g., `scraper.ipynb`) and open it.

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to input the Twitter username (e.g., `@example_user`) and execute the cells to scrape the tweets.

### Notes

- Ensure you comply with Twitter's API and scraping policies when running this code.
- If the notebook relies on Twitter's API, ensure you have valid credentials and update the configuration as necessary.
